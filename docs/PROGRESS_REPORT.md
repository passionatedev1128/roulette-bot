# Progress Report Messages

## Day 1 & 2 Report

**Option 1 (Technical Focus):**
```
I've completed the initial project setup and core development for the Brazilian Roulette Bot. The bot architecture is fully implemented with screen detection, betting strategies (Martingale, Fibonacci, Custom), automated betting system, and comprehensive logging. I've also created detailed implementation guides, validation tools, and coordinate capture utilities to ensure a smooth setup process. The codebase is ready for testing and configuration with your specific game interface.
```

**Option 2 (Progress Focus):**
```
I've finished the complete bot implementation with all core modules: detection system, strategy engine, betting automation, and logging. The project includes comprehensive documentation, validation tools, and helper scripts to simplify setup and testing. Next steps are to configure betting coordinates for your specific game interface and test detection accuracy with your video file.
```

**Option 3 (Client-Friendly):**
```
I've completed the full bot development with all requested features: automatic result detection, color-based betting strategies, gale system, and maintenance betting to keep sessions active. I've created step-by-step guides and tools to help configure the bot for your game interface. The bot is ready for testing once we configure the betting button coordinates for your specific platform.
```

**Option 4 (Briefest):**
```
I've completed the bot implementation with detection, betting strategies, and automation systems. Documentation and configuration tools are ready. Next step is configuring betting coordinates for your game interface.
```

**Option 5 (Detailed but Brief):**
```
I've completed the full bot development including screen detection (OpenCV + OCR), three betting strategies (Martingale, Fibonacci, Custom), automated betting with pyautogui, gale system, and comprehensive logging. The project includes implementation guides, validation tools, and coordinate capture utilities. Ready for configuration and testing with your game interface.
