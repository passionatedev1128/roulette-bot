# Where Are Even/Odd Betting Areas on Roulette Tables?

This guide shows where Even and Odd betting areas are typically located on roulette tables.

## Common Locations

### 1. **Main Betting Table (Most Common)**

Even/Odd areas are usually located **below or near the number grid**, often grouped with other outside bets:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           ROULETTE TABLE                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Number Grid: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 36]            │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ Outside Bets Area:                      │   │
│  │                                         │   │
│  │  [1-18]  [19-36]  [RED]  [BLACK]       │   │
│  │                                         │   │
│  │  [EVEN]  [ODD]    [LOW]  [HIGH]        │   │ ← Even/Odd here
│  │                                         │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                 │
│  [Confirm Button]                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Side Panel Layout**

Some tables have Even/Odd in a side panel:

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│              │  [Number Grid]               │
│  Side Panel  │                              │
│              │                              │
│  [RED]       │                              │
│  [BLACK]     │                              │
│  [EVEN]  ←───┼─── Even/Odd here            │
│  [ODD]   ←───┼─── Even/Odd here            │
│  [1-18]      │                              │
│  [19-36]     │                              │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Around the Number Grid**

Sometimes Even/Odd are positioned around the edges of the number grid:

```
        [EVEN]
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   [Number Grid]     │
│   0, 1, 2, ... 36   │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
        [ODD]
```

## Visual Indicators

### What to Look For:

1. **Text Labels:**
   - "Even" or "Par" (Portuguese)
   - "Odd" or "Ímpar" (Portuguese)
   - "E" or "O" symbols
   - "P" or "I" (Par/Ímpar)

2. **Button Appearance:**
   - Usually rectangular buttons
   - Often same size as Red/Black buttons
   - May have colored backgrounds
   - Sometimes grouped together

3. **Position Relative to Other Bets:**
   - Near Red/Black areas

## Brazilian Roulette Specific

On **Roleta Brasileira** tables, Even/Odd are typically:

- **Labeled as:** "Par" (Even) and "Ímpar" (Odd)
- **Located:** Below the number grid, in the outside bets area
- **Grouped with:** Red/Black, 1-18/19-36, Low/High

## Step-by-Step: Finding Even/Odd Areas

### Method 1: Look for Text Labels

1. **Scan the betting table** for text that says:
   - "Even" / "Par"
   - "Odd" / "Ímpar"
   - "E" / "O"
   - "P" / "I"

2. **Check below the number grid** - most common location

3. **Look near Red/Black buttons** - often grouped together

### Method 2: Look for Button Patterns

1. **Find Red/Black buttons** (you probably already have these)
2. **Look next to them** - Even/Odd are often nearby
3. **Check for similar-sized buttons** in the same area

### Method 3: Use Your Snapshot

1. **Open your snapshot** in an image viewer
2. **Look for buttons/areas** that might be Even/Odd:
   - Rectangular buttons
   - Near Red/Black
   - In outside bets area
3. **If unsure, try clicking** - some games show tooltips

## Common Layout Examples

### Example 1: Traditional Layout
```
Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 36

Outside Bets:
[1-18] [19-36] [RED] [BLACK] [EVEN] [ODD]
```

### Example 2: Vertical Layout
```
[RED]
[BLACK]
[EVEN]  ← Even here
[ODD]   ← Odd here
[1-18]
[19-36]
```

### Example 3: Grid Layout
```
[RED]    [BLACK]
[EVEN]   [ODD]
[1-18]   [19-36]
```

## If You Can't Find Even/Odd Areas

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Table doesn't have Even/Odd betting:**
   - Some roulette variants don't offer Even/Odd
   - Check if your table supports this bet type

2. **Different naming:**
   - Might be labeled in Portuguese only
   - Look for "Par" and "Ímpar"

3. **Hidden in menu:**
   - Some tables have betting options in a menu
   - Check for a "More Bets" or "Outside Bets" button

4. **Different layout:**
   - Your table might have a unique layout
   - Check all areas of the betting table

### What to Do:

1. **Check the game rules/help:**
   - Look for betting options documentation
   - Check if Even/Odd is available

2. **Test manually:**
   - Try clicking different areas
   - See if any area selects Even/Odd

3. **Contact support:**
   - Ask the game provider where Even/Odd betting is located

4. **Use alternative:**
   - If Even/Odd isn't available, you might need to:
     - Use number-based betting (bet all even/odd numbers)
     - Or use a different strategy

## Tips for Your Snapshot

1. **Zoom in:**
   - Use image viewer zoom to see small text
   - Look for "Par" or "Ímpar" text

2. **Check all areas:**
   - Don't just look below numbers
   - Check sides, corners, menus

3. **Compare with Red/Black:**
   - If you know where Red/Black are
   - Even/Odd are usually nearby

4. **Look for patterns:**
   - Even/Odd buttons usually look similar
   - Same size, same style as other outside bets
